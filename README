ALF (Alert Log Finder) allows you to get to the alert log of an Oracle database automatically without 
manually navigating "bdump" or "diag" directories (depending on the software version).  All you have to
do is run ". oraenv" command and specify ORACLE_SID, after which you can use the script.

Example:

$ . oraenv
ORACLE_SID = [orcl] ? chicago
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
$ ./alf.sh

This opens the alert log with "less" command so you are free to navigate it.

Note:

It is convenient to place ALF in your common scripts directory (e.g. /u01/app/oracle/scripts) and create
a short alias for it in .bashrc:

alias al='/u01/app/oracle/scripts/alert/alf.sh'

After that you can call it anywhere via "al" command.
